Contained In this folder are my approaches in solving:
1. The popularly known Titanic Challenge, where a ship collided with an iceberg which led to the sinking(Classification Problem)

2. The Housing Price Challenge. It pertains houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data(Regression Problem)

Moreso, low level Tensorflow will then be compared to Keras Neural Network functionalities.
